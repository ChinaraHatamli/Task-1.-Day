<h1> Lev Landau </h1>
<hr> 
<p> <strong> Lev Davidovich Landau </strong>  (22 January 1908 - 1 April 1968) was a Soviet <em> physicist </em> who made fundamental  contributions to many areas of <i> theoretical physics.</i> <sup> [1][2][3] </sup> </p>
<p> His accomplishments include the independent co-discovery of the <i> density matrix </i> method <sup> [4][5] </sup> in <i> quantum mechanics </i> (alongside <b> John von Neumann </b>), the quantum mechanical theory of <i> diamagnetism </i>, the theory of <i> superfluidity </i>, the theory of <i> second-order phase transitions </i>, invention of <i> order parameter </i> technique, <sup> [6] </sup> the <i> Ginzburgâ€“Landau theory </i> of <i> superconductivity </i>, the theory of <i> Fermi liquids </i>, the explanation of <i> Landau damping </i> in <i> plasma physics </i>, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of neutrinos, and Landau's equations for <strong> S </strong> matrix singularities <sup> [7] </sup> </p> 
<p> He received the 1962 <strong> Nobel Prize in Physics </strong> for his development of a mathematical theory of <i> superfluidity </i> that accounts for the properties of <i> liquid helium II </i> at a temperature below 2.17 K (-270.98 C) <sup> [8] </sup> </p>
